Let's begin creating our api.
<br />
From your terminal, create a new SAM application by running the command `sam init` and following the prompts.
<br />
Take a look at the screenshots below

<br />
From your favorite IDE, open up the app you just created and let's get started.
<br />

You'll probably have a folder structure looking like this. Delete the events folder and rename the hello_world folder to
babysitter.
<br />

Add another folder called `schema`. This folder would contain our graphql schema.
<br />

Inside the babysitter folder, create 2 folders called entities and resolvers.
